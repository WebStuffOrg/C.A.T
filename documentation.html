                <h5> 1.2.3 Primary Goals and Selection of Project Topic </h5>
                <p>When distributing responsibilities within our team, we adhered to a core principle: we divided the work by functionality instead of by techniques. 
                This strategy was vital to us, as it guaranteed that each team member was engaged in various aspects of the application's development, thus broadening their 
                technical expertise.

                Their widespread popularity on social media and in contemporary culture further illustrates their ability to capture the attention and affection of people around the world. 
                By exploring their multifaceted roles across different societies, we can gain a deeper understanding of our connection to these enigmatic creatures. </p>
                    
                <h5> 1.2.5 Assigning Responsibilities </h5>
            <p> By allocating responsibilities according to entire pages rather than individual tasks, we ensured that every team member was comprehensively involved in the project.</p>
                <p>- <b> Chiara Martina</b>: Responsable for the main page and the timeline page.<br>
                    - <b> Elvira Kushlak</b>: Resposable to the map page.<br>
