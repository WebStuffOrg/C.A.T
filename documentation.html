            <h5>1.3 Narratives and Sub-Narratives</h5>
            <p>
                The selection of these narratives—Geography, Daily Life, and Supernatural—is rooted in their ability to provide a holistic and comprehensive exploration of cats. Each narrative framework was chosen to highlight distinct aspects of the cat-human relationship. These narratives were chosen to offer a well-rounded exploration of cats, balancing the everyday with the extraordinary, the global with the personal, and the historical with the mystical.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h4>2 Idea Development</h4>

            <h5>2.1 Brainstorming Categories</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Organization of Ideas:</b> We utilized mind maps to visually connect and explore the various themes related to cats, enabling us to see relationships and identify key concepts.</li>
                <li><b>Case Study:</b> By analyzing previous exhibitions, we drew inspiration from different approaches and practices.</li>
                <li><b>Visual Experimentation:</b> We developed prototypes to test different layouts and visual representations, ensuring that our design effectively communicates our themes.</li>

            </ul>

            <h5>2.2 Techniques for Ideation in Design</h5>
            <p>
                In our design process, we utilized Mind Mapping as a key ideation technique. This visual tool allowed us to brainstorm and organize ideas around the central theme of the cultural impact of cats. Starting with a core concept, we branched out into related themes, such as mythology, daily life, and artistic representation. This approach fostered creativity and collaboration, enabling team members to contribute unique perspectives and discover unexpected connections. Overall, mind mapping was essential in developing a rich narrative for our exhibition, effectively showcasing the diverse roles of cats throughout history.
            </p>

            <h5>2.3 Primary Goals and Selection of Project Topic</h5>
            <p>
                When distributing responsibilities within our team, we adhered to a core principle: we divided the work by functionality instead of by techniques. This strategy was vital to us, as it guaranteed that each team member was engaged in various aspects of the application's development, thus broadening their technical expertise.
            </p>

            <h5>2.4 Popularity of the Animal as a Topic</h5>
            <p>
                These beloved pets are cherished globally, captivating us with their diversity, endearing behaviors, and the emotional bonds many people form with them. Additionally, cats are steeped in cultural symbolism, having held significant roles in various civilizations, from revered deities to icons of mystery and independence. Their widespread popularity on social media and in contemporary culture further illustrates their ability to capture the attention and affection of people around the world. By exploring their multifaceted roles across different societies, we can gain a deeper understanding of our connection to these enigmatic creatures.
            </p>

            <h5>2.5 Assigning Responsibilities</h5>
            <p>
                By allocating responsibilities according to entire pages rather than individual tasks, we ensured that every team member was comprehensively involved in the project.
            </p>

            <p>Typography choices prioritize clarity and aesthetic alignment with the project’s theme:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Fonts</b>: 'Nunito' is used for body text due to its clean and readable style, while 'Comfortaa' is used for headers, adding a modern and welcoming tone.</li>
                <li><b>Hierarchy and consistency</b>: A clear typographic hierarchy (bold for headings, regular weight for body text) is maintained throughout, providing structure and consistency. Font sizes are adjusted responsively to ensure readability across devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>4.1.3 Layout and Grid System</h6>
            <p>The layout leverages a flexible, responsive grid to ensure accessibility and ease of navigation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Grid structure</b>: CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to adapt the layout dynamically, with multiple columns on larger screens and single columns on mobile for streamlined viewing.</li>
                <li><b>Page structure</b>: A consistent navigation bar and footer across all pages maintain user familiarity. Content blocks are designed to maintain spacing and alignment, preventing clutter and enhancing readability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>4.1.4 Iconography and Imagery</h6>

            <h6>Visual Design</h6>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Color Scheme</b>: The Collection page employs the same palette as the rest of the site—light beige (#FAF3EF) backgrounds with accent colors such as Deep Red (#6B1A10) for buttons. The consistent color use aligns with the overall theme, making the page feel part of the broader experience.</li>
                <li><b>Typography</b>: ‘Comfortaa’ is used for headings, reinforcing a friendly aesthetic, while the body text uses ‘Nunito’ to maintain readability. Font sizes are set to provide contrast between headings, descriptions, and captions.</li>

            <h6>4.2.5 Gallery Page</h6>
            <h6>Overview</h6>
            <p>The gallery page is meant to browse the artworks of the exhibition with a high focus on the images themselves, accompanying them with useful and interesting information. That's way it's the endpoint of all the other pages</p>
            <h6>Visual design</h6>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Color Scheme</b>: The Collection page employs the same palette as the rest of the site—light beige (#FAF3EF) backgrounds with accent colors such as Deep Red (#6B1A10) for buttons. The consistent color use aligns with the overall theme, making the page feel part of the broader experience.</li>
                <li><b>Typography</b>: ‘Comfortaa’ is used for headings, reinforcing a friendly aesthetic, while the body text uses ‘Nunito’ to maintain readability (especially important in the description of the artworks). Font sizes are set to provide contrast between headings, descriptions, and captions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Layout</h6>
            <p>The layout of the gallery page is designed to focus the attention of the user on the image, while still ensuring that other information is not overshadowed by the images.</p>
            <p>The layout is mainly based on the <strong>Bootstrap grid system</strong> and is composed by two main components: a row for the image display and one for the <strong>information display</strong> about the current artwork</p>
            <p>The image display consists in an image container spanning the entire hight on the viewport and 95% of the viewport width from medium screens onwards. This way, we intend to centralize the focus on the artwork as soon as the user is directed to the gallery.</p>
            <p>The image container is also provided with the necessary navigational features for a gallery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>browsing buttons to navigate sequentially through narratives;</li>
                <li>an offcanvas that provides the list of artworks included in the current narrative, to navigate them non-sequentially;</li>
                <li>a button which redirects to the Narratives page.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scrolling down or using the scroll button on the right-bottom side leads the user to the information display. It consists of a series of three rows that span for 8/12 of the viewport, comprising:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an <strong>HTML table</strong> with metadata about the artwork</li>
                <li>a column-oriented <strong>narrative-switch buttons container</strong>, organized by main narratives</li>
                <li>a <strong>description</strong> of the artwork, offering three different raeding levels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the remaining space to the right of this section, a sticky card gets visible as soon as the main image disappears from the viewport, to relay the importance of image even when the image container is not visible. The sticky card has the same sequential navigation buttons and a header stating the current narrative.</p>


            <h6>Interactive Design and User Experience</h6>
            <p>The gallery uses two main types of buttons, using clear visual cues to lead the user:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the <strong>red buttons</strong> signal navigational interactions</li>
                <li>the <strong>violet buttons</strong> instead indicate interactions that only affect part of the layout or temporary overlays (like the offcanvas being toggled)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The design of the gallery allows it to be a full single page application, allowing the user to swiftly switch between narratives and subnarratives through the button in the info section. Nonetheless, it is also efficiently linked to other pages like the Narratives one, but also the Timeline, using the button in the table.</p>           
            <p>As alredy mentioned, the page reacts to the user moving inside it, with an fade-in fade-out animation assigned to the lateral image to give a more reactive feel to the page.</p>
            <h6>Mobile-Specific Adjustments</h6>
            <p>To adapt to small screen sizes, the gallery page layout undergoes a series of modifications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>reduced image container: the height is limited to 75vh for screens under 760px;</li>
                <li>image header translation: the image container header, transparent on medium screens, gets pushed out the image container by applying negative margin on it, to prevent it from covering too much of the reduced size image container</li>
                <li>lateral card removal: this is done to give more space to the rest of the content, which occupies the entire viewport width on small screens.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>4.2.6 Timeline Page</h6>
            <h6>Overview</h6>
            <p>The Timeline page illustrates, in chronological order from oldest to newest, the specific items related to cats. Each entry on the timeline is enriched with images, dates and descriptions.</p>

            <h6>Visual Design</h6>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Color Scheme</b>:<br>
                Red (rgb(107, 26, 16)) for borders and buttons: This is a strong and energetic color, which immediately attracts attention. Used for borders and buttons to highlight interactive elements. <br>
                Purple (rgb(103, 49, 75)) for the line connecting timeline events: this colour adds sophistication without overpowering other colors, and stands out from red, creating a clear contrast between major events and interactions.<br>
                Light-Beige (rgb(250, 243, 239)) background is chosen to contrast with the more vibrant colors like red and purple, creating a neutral base that does not disturb the reading of the text. The semi-transparency makes the design lighter, giving a modern touch, without obscuring the other elements. 
                <li><b>Typography</b>: Comfortaa and Nunito contribute to a modern, accessible look with balanced sizes for desktop and mobile.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Layout</h6>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Centered layout</b>: the timeline is positioned vertically in the center of the page.</li>
                <li><b>Alternating arrangement</b>: content blocks are distributed to the left and right of the center line, creating a visual balance.</li>
                <li><b>Vertical timeline</b>:  A vertical central line slowly extends from top to bottom, with each event appearing in sequence, making the time flow clear and visible.</li>    
                <li><b>Sequential animation</b>: each element (text and image) appears with variable delays of 0.5 seconds, creating a gradual presentation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Interactive Design</h6>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Vertical scroll</b>: the vertical scroll function allows smooth navigation between events.</li>
                <li><b>Visual transition effects</b>: content blocks trigger visual transitions as you scroll, making the experience dynamic and engaging.</li>
                <li><b>Direct links</b>: gallery links allow you to explore each event in more detail.</li>    
            </ul>


            <h6>User Experience and Accessibility</h6>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Text Contrast</b>: the chosen colors (dark red, purple and beige) provide a good contrast, improving the readability of the text.</li>
                <li><b>Clear content</b>: texts are written in a simple and clear manner, and the page structure is well organized with a logical hierarchy of information. This helps to comply with WCAG 3.1.1, which requires content to be understandable and easily readable. </li>
            </ul>
          
            <h6>Mobile-Specific Adjustments</h6>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Responsive timeline</b>: it adapts completely to small screens, keeping readability. The timeline line fits the reduced width.</li>
                <li><b>Full width content blocks</b>: content extends to take advantage of the full width available and images fit better on small screens. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Give the simplicity of our website, we opted to store all the data needed to run the website in JSON, one of the most widely used data formats on the Web. The JSON is structured to describe both individual artworks (items) and curated narratives (thematic groupings) that offer viewers different perspectives on the artworks based on specific themes.</p>
            <p>The JSON has three sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meta</strong>: General information about the exhibition.</li>
                <li><strong>Items</strong>: Detailed descriptions of each artwork included in the exhibition.</li>
                <li><strong>Narratives</strong>: Thematic groupings of items to convey different aspects of cats in art history.</li>
            </ul>



            <h6>4.3.1 <code>meta</code> Object</h6>
            <p>The meta object contains the exhibition's metadata, which provides context for the JSON structure and supports front-end application display options.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>title: String - The name of the exhibition, "Cats Art Exhibition."</li>
                <li>description: String - A summary of the exhibition’s focus, emphasizing the theme of cats represented in art globally and historically.</li>
                <li>narrativesList: Array - Lists available narrative themes, such as geographic regions ("Europe," "Asia"), themes of behavior ("Playing," "Hunting"), and symbolic roles ("Supernatural," "Religion").</li>
                <li>defaultNarrative: String - Sets the default viewing narrative to "Timeline," presenting the artworks in chronological order.</li>
                <li>defaultStart: Number - Index position for the default start item.</li>
                <li>defaultText: String - Sets the default text level, here "basic," which displays basic descriptive text for each artwork.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>4.3.2 <code>items</code> Object</h6>

            <p>The items object holds all the artworks included in the exhibition, each uniquely identified by a numerical key. Each item represents an artwork and contains detailed properties describing it.</p>
            <p>Each artwork object contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>title: String - The name of the artwork.</li>
                <li>creator: String - Artist or creator of the artwork. If unknown, listed as "Unknown."</li>
                <li>time: String - Date or period when the artwork was created.</li>
                <li>origin: String - The cultural or geographic origin of the artwork.</li>
                <li>type: String - The category or form of the artwork (e.g., "Textile," "Sculpture," "Painting").</li>
                <li>medium: String - Materials used in creating the artwork.</li>
                <li>dimensions: String - Physical dimensions of the artwork; may be "Unknown" if unspecified.</li>
                <li>img: String - Path to an image file representing the artwork.</li>
                <li>text: Object - Contains three text levels (basic, extended, long) to provide different depths of information about the artwork.</li>
                <li>basic: Concise information about the artwork.</li>
                <li>extended: A more detailed description, adding context or additional interpretive information.</li>
                <li>long: A comprehensive description, often including historical and cultural insights.</li>
                <li>includedIn: Array - Lists the narrative themes in which the artwork appears. This allows each artwork to be included in multiple narratives and helps structure the user’s thematic experience.</li> 
            </ul> 
            <p>The first seven are the fields used for the metadata description of the artworks in the exhibition. We chose these given how they align with some of the most important standards used in visual arts resource description, like CDWA and DC.</p>


            <p>Example
                An example of the structure of an item:
            </p>

            <img src="images/doc/json_example.png" alt="" width="1200">
                
            <br><br>
            
            <h6>4.3.3 <code>narratives</code> Object</h6>

            <p>The narratives object defines thematic groupings of artworks, helping present items in various thematic arrangements. Each key is a theme name, and its value is an array of item IDs referencing artworks in the items section.</p>
            <p>Narratives can have a certain number of subnarratives, which can be seen as subclasses of the narrative's theme, allowing the visitor for a more granular pathway selection, based on their interests</p>
            <p>The four main narratives with their respective sub-narratiives are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timeline</strong>: chronological arrangement of artworks, following the Timeline page.</li>
                <li><strong>Geography</strong>: it's the narrative chosen for the exhibition display. It displays the artworks by continents (<strong>Asia, Europe, Africa, Americas</strong>), to highlight cultural differences.</li>
                <li><strong>Daily</strong>: a thematic narrative focused on showing artworks portaing the everyday-life of cats, comprising <strong>Hunting, Chilling, Playing</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Supernatural</strong>: another thematic narrative centered around the commonly otherwordly and mysterious features attributed to cat among cultures and in different times. The subnarratives for Supernatural are <strong>Folklore, Religion and Superstition</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>By structuring the narratives this way, the suggested pathways through the exhibition are clearly defined in a non-redundant way, leveraging the IDs defined in the "items" section. Using arrays facilitates the adaptability of the project to any changes curators or the institution may want to apply in the future.</p>

            <h4>6 Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                This project aligns with the requirements of the TTTTTT framework, aiming to create an engaging, informative, and visually cohesive digital companion for an exhibition of physical artifacts. By exploring cats' diverse cultural and historical representations, we fulfill the core objectives: connecting visitors to the exhibit’s items through rich narratives, informative timelines, and geo-referenced visuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach to design and content emphasizes <b>automatic, believable, complete, and deliberate</b> (ABCD) principles. We have structured narratives—Geography, Daily Life, and Supernatural—to guide visitors, providing multiple layers of storytelling that accommodate varying levels of user background and interest. Each item's detailed metadata and description levels (from basic to advanced) ensure accessibility for diverse audiences, from young students to scholars. This framework also allows users to switch seamlessly between narratives and detail levels, enhancing their experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through thoughtful typography, responsive layouts, and interactive components, we have built a visually pleasing and functional interface that reflects the project’s goals. The final result not only provides a meaningful exploration of cats in art and culture but also serves as a flexible, structured template for digital exhibitions, supporting the TTTTTT project’s vision of creating adaptable and immersive virtual museum experiences.
