            <h5>1.1.2 Narratives and Sub-Narratives</h5>
            <p>
                The selection of these narratives—Geography, Daily Life, and Supernatural—is rooted in their ability to provide a holistic and comprehensive exploration of cats. Each narrative framework was chosen to highlight distinct aspects of the cat-human relationship. These narratives were chosen to offer a well-rounded exploration of cats, balancing the everyday with the extraordinary, the global with the personal, and the historical with the mystical.

            <h5>1.2.2 Techniques for Ideation in Design</h5>
            <p>
                In our design process, we utilized Mind Mapping as a key ideation technique. This visual tool allowed us to brainstorm and organize ideas around the central theme of the cultural impact of cats. Starting with a core concept, we branched out into related themes, such as mythology, daily life, and artistic representation. This approach fostered creativity and collaboration, enabling team members to contribute unique perspectives and discover unexpected connections. Overall, mind mapping was essential in developing a rich narrative for our exhibition, effectively showcasing the diverse roles of cats throughout history.
            </p>

            <h5>1.2.3 Primary Goals and Selection of Project Topic</h5>
            <p>
                When distributing responsibilities within our team, we adhered to a core principle: we divided the work by functionality instead of by techniques. This strategy was vital to us, as it guaranteed that each team member was engaged in various aspects of the application's development, thus broadening their technical expertise.
            </p>

            <h5>1.2.4 Popularity of the Animal as a Topic</h5>
            <p>
                These beloved pets are cherished globally, captivating us with their diversity, endearing behaviors, and the emotional bonds many people form with them. Additionally, cats are steeped in cultural symbolism, having held significant roles in various civilizations, from revered deities to icons of mystery and independence. Their widespread popularity on social media and in contemporary culture further illustrates their ability to capture the attention and affection of people around the world. By exploring their multifaceted roles across different societies, we can gain a deeper understanding of our connection to these enigmatic creatures.
            </p>

            <h5>1.2.5 Assigning Responsibilities</h5>
            <p>
                By allocating responsibilities according to entire pages rather than individual tasks, we ensured that every team member was comprehensively involved in the project.

                <li><b>Usage</b>: Backgrounds are mainly light beige, supporting readability. Text uses dark colors for high contrast, and interactive elements like buttons and links are highlighted with deeper tones to signal actions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2.1.2 Typography</h6>
            <p>Typography choices prioritize clarity and aesthetic alignment with the project’s theme:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Fonts</b>: 'Nunito' is used for body text due to its clean and readable style, while 'Comfortaa' is used for headers, adding a modern and welcoming tone.</li>
                <li><b>Hierarchy and consistency</b>: A clear typographic hierarchy (bold for headings, regular weight for body text) is maintained throughout, providing structure and consistency. Font sizes are adjusted responsively to ensure readability across devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2.1.3 Layout and Grid System</h6>
            <p>The layout leverages a flexible, responsive grid to ensure accessibility and ease of navigation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Grid structure</b>: CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to adapt the layout dynamically, with multiple columns on larger screens and single columns on mobile for streamlined viewing.</li>
                <li><b>Page structure</b>: A consistent navigation bar and footer across all pages maintain user familiarity. Content blocks are designed to maintain spacing and alignment, preventing clutter and enhancing readability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2.1.4 Iconography and Imagery</h6>
            <p>The project minimizes icon usage to keep focus on the artwork while supporting key navigational functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Icons</b>: Simple icons are used sparingly for essential actions, such as navigation and social media links, maintaining a minimalist look.</li>
                <li><b>Images</b>: Artwork images are displayed in high resolution and dynamically scaled to fit within the responsive grid. Hover effects reveal supplementary information, ensuring an engaging and informative visual experience.</li>
            </ul><br>

                <li><b>Color Scheme</b>: Backgrounds use light beige (#FAF3EF), consistent with the site’s neutral tones, creating a subtle canvas that does not detract from the map’s content. Interactive map points use accent colors such as Deep Red (#6B1A10), which stand out clearly against the background.</li>
                <li><b>Typography</b>: Titles are presented in ‘Comfortaa’ for a modern, accessible style, while exhibit descriptions use ‘Nunito’ to ensure readability in small font sizes. Headings and subheadings are bolded to provide a clear hierarchy in the information panel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>2.2.1.3 Layout</h6>
            <ul>
